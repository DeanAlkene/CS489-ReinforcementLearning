## 0. Introduction

In this assignment, we are required to implement Monte-Carlo (MC) Learning and Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning. These are two methods that can evaluate a given policy directly by learning from episodes of experience without knowledge of MDP model. We will still implement these methods based on GridWorld.

Environment:

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python 3.7.4
